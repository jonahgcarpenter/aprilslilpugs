# April's Lil Pugs

A website for my moms buisness, in which I have tailored to her request.

## Technologies

### LOCAL RTSP STREAM SERVER

- using a separate docker container, I self-host a RTSP stream server for the live puppy cam
- [rtmps-hls-server](https://github.com/JamiePhonic/rtmps-hls-server)

### MERN Stack

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node

## TODO

- create separate branch for server/ to make it easy for unraid
- implement actual images functionality
- move RTSP stream into this codebase?
